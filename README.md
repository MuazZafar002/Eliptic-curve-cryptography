# ECC Encryption and Decryption:
This repository contains code for Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) implementation for encryption and decryption using JavaScript.

# Overview :
The repository consists of three main files:

## ecc.js: 
Contains the JavaScript code implementing ECC encryption and decryption logic.
## index.html: 
An HTML file providing a simple user interface to interact with ECC encryption and decryption functions.
## styles.css: 
CSS file defining the styling for the HTML interface.


# Usage:

Getting Started
To use this implementation:
Clone or download the repository.
Open the index.html file in a web browser.
# Key Generation:
Click on the "Generate Keys" button in the "Key Generation" section.
This action generates ECC public and private keys using the P-256 curve and displays them in the interface.
# Encryption:
Enter the plaintext message in the "Plain Text" input field in the "Encryption" section.
Click on the "Encrypt" button.
The encrypted ciphertext will be displayed in the interface.
# Decryption:
Enter the ciphertext in the "Cipher Text" input field in the "Decryption" section.
Click on the "Decrypt" button.
The decrypted plaintext will be displayed in the interface.
# Dependencies :
The code relies on the Web Crypto API for cryptographic operations, ensuring secure key generation, encryption, and decryption.
It uses jQuery for DOM manipulation in the provided HTML file.
# Notes:
Ensure a modern web browser supporting the Web Crypto API is used for proper functionality.
This implementation uses the P-256 elliptic curve for key generation and encryption/decryption.
